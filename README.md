# Random Intelligence
## A simulation to conceptualize the difficulty of evolution

We've all been told that all life came about purely by random chance. This application is designed to illustrate the improbability of that assertion.

When you hit start, your computer will begin generating strings roughly 50 characters in length. There is a 25% probability of getting a space rather than a character and all extra spaces are removed (we'll cheat like that just a bit to give evolution a hand). Each string will be checked for words against the webster's dictionary and the best ones will be shown.

Of course, English isn't exactly the same as the language of amino acid chains or DNA, but the concept of randomly happening upon legitimate information by pure luck is the same. It surely isn't that much easier for new useful designs to spring up from random sequences of amino acids than it is for meaningful sentances to randomly spring up from random strings of characters. This is just to give you a general feel of how extreme the odds are.

Note: It starts off very slow (because the ranking part is slow), but it speeds up a ton when it isn't updating the top scorers every other second.
